# BitLearn
A guide and actual cryptocurrency, I am writing as I do it and learn more.

Firstly, I will make a coin with the same characteristics as bitcoin, hopefully I'll be able to make it work further than just proof of concept.    
Because I am building BitLearn to work like Bitcoin, some tools can be used for both (e.g. wallet_generator.py).

Once I am comfortable enough, I will make BitLearn try some new features such as PoS, other algorithms, and such. But this will be later later later.

I hope you enjoy your journey into the heart of cryptocurrencies !
